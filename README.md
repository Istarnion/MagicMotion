Magic Motion
============

Magic Motion is a library for making entire rooms digitally interactive. It builds point clouds from one or several RGB-D sensors and does
background subtraction.

The background subtraction algorithm is built as part of my masters thesis, and is fully decoupled from the RGB-D sensor interface. It is fully
applicable to any real time point cloud application.


This repository consists of two parts: the main library (with source code in src/) and a test application/visualizer (with source in launchpad/).

## Coming soon
I will upload a labeled data set for training and testing.

## Acknowledgement
Much thanks to @ocornut for writing Dear ImGui, and @nothings for all the stb libraries.
